## ðŸ’» About the project
Trunfo is a card game that consists of taking all the cards of the other participants through choices of characteristics of each card (eg speed, height, card game, game). A Trunfo is normally based on a theme such as Cars, Football Players and even Animals. In this project I developed a Trunfo maker based on a famous online game named Ragnarok Online where you can add as many cards as you like and filter them.
